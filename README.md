# Car-Symboling-Prediction-Regression
BASED ON GIVEN FEATURE AND MESUREMENT PREDICT THE PRICE

# <b>TASK 1
#### <b>PREPARE A COMPLETE DATA ANALYSIS REPORT ON THE GIVEN DATA.

# <b>TASK 2
#### <b>Prepare the data, identifying and extracting key features (both input and output parameters) relevant to the problem you will solve.
#### <b>Build and train a machine learning model. Here you can evaluate different algorithms, settings and see which model is best for your scenario


### <b>TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING PROBLEM.
- <b>Regression is a supervised learning technique where the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value for each data point, based on labeled training data consisting of input features and their corresponding real-valued outputs.<br>
### <b>ALGORITHM USES FOR REGRESSION
<b>
    
- Linear Regression
- KNN
- RANDOM FOREST
- SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSOR
- DECISION TREE
- GRADIENT BOOST
- XGBOOST


## <b>Conclusion for Support Vector Machine (Regressor)
The objective of this SVM Regressor analysis was to examine how various factors of car impact car prices.<br>
The model explains approximately -0.085 of the variation in car prices (RÂ² = -0.085)
